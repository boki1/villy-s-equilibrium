## Welcome to the Equilibrium project
This is my diploma thesis for high school, year 2021-2022! 

It is a light-weight fluid simulator based on Jos Stam's paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf). The project is written in Rust and the algorithm is wrapped with an application that uses the [egui](github.com/emilk/egui) framework. 

The Stam's algorithm is advanced by adding obstacles support. However, the supported obstacles are only rectangles that are parallel to the Ox and Oy axises. 

### Official documentation
The full official documentation is only available in Bulgarian - [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iyKuNL2C-F815OfA3zp7YDAowyzz9D67?usp=sharing).

If you wish to generate the technical documentation, you can run ```cargo d --open``` after cloning the current repo.

### Start the project
To start the project, you shall clone the project (or download it as `.zip`), and write `cargo r` after having Rust on your computer. That's it!
